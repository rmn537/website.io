        Founded in 2025, LitSphere is a literary magazine devoted to students  publishing their literary work digitally and students of all ages can fully access them all around the globe. We publish educational, poetry, fiction, nonfiction, and hybrid works that can touch all audiencesâ€™ hearts.
        Our mission is to educate and improve literary skills for all young readers around the world. Not only are we digital, but also provide our work by paper at local schools, hospitals, and shelters. This way we amplify the work of our writers and uncover raw voices.
        
        Run by a diverse collective of writers, educators, and artists, we aim to build a space where creative risk is celebrated and literary boundaries are constantly reimagined.
